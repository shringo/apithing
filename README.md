# Precursor: WTF is an API?

APIs (Application Programming Interface), (in this context) simply put, allow the general public to call a URL and to submit or receive data from your database or backend. More generally, it implements calls to a library or a backend service.

For example, if you wanted to contact Twitter to see all your private tweets, you would send a `GET` request to a URL looking something like this:

```
twitter.com/api/paid/v2/users/<id>/tweets
```

...including credentials, so everyone can't freely access your tweets. The response would come back in a `JSON` object for webpages as it easily integrates into JavaScript. To determine if an API was written well, it a) comes with documentation, b) has consistency and c) has security (credentials) to access specific parts.

```json
[
    {
        "handler": "@mccafe",
        "content": "lol",

        "sent": 1697780425858,
        "likes": 69,
        "retweets": 420,
        "shares": 2,
        "views": 9
    },
    {
        "handler": "@mccafe",
        "content": "bruh",

        "sent": 1689680325725,
        "likes": 1,
        "retweets": 10,
        "shares": 5,
        "views": 3
    }
]
```

# Setting up

## Lang: TypeScript

We will be using tRPC, Next.js, Prisma, and MongoDB. You are required to use TypeScript. It's the same as JavaScript, but introduces types. Simply put, you can do this in JavaScript:

```js
var a = 69;

a = "69";
```

But do it in TypeScript and you will get an error! TypeScript essentially enforces type checking, so you can't say a function that returns the addition of two numbers returns a string. TS gets compiled to JS code.

## Will not be showing 'hosting' for the actual site

The tutorial shows services like Axiom and Vercel, which essentially host the website for you.

## First, make a T3 App

Run the command: `npm create t3-app@latest`

You will be greeted with just about the fanciest UI in your terminal. 

Choose Typescript. Choosing Javascript will result in a big middle finger. See [this](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app/issues/117)

Use Tailwinds CSS

Use tRPC

Select None (for auth provider)

Select Prisma for the database ORM.

'No' for app router

Sure, initialize a git repo cuz ynot

Let it run npm install.

## MongoDB Setup

Do the steps listed on the Coding Prison Notes on how to make a MongoDB account & database.

Find the `./.env` file and replace it with the DB URL you copied. YOU NEED TO MAKE A DB ON MONGODB THAT HAS A TABLE CALLED `Posts`. It looks like this:

```
mongodb+srv://name:password@projectname.idk.mongodb.net/nameofdatabase
```

The password is not and needs to be substituted into the URL or you will get an authorization error when running.

Run `npx prisma studio` and a tab will be opened. Navigate to localhost:5555 if you were not automatically taken there. Click on "Posts".

**An error will be expected.** Stop the program, go to `./prisma/schema.prisma` and make the following change:

```diff
datasource db {
--    provider = "sqlite"
++    provider = "mongodb"
    url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model Post {
--    id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
++    id        String   @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
```

Because we switched from SQLite to MongoDB, the functions are different. Mongo does not know what `autoincrement` is, so a hacky change was made after looking at [Kobe's code](https://github.com/KobeUyeda/React-t3-trpc/blob/main/trpctest/prisma/schema.prisma).

If you did not make the changes, you will see this error:

```log
Error: Prisma schema validation - (get-config wasm)
Error code: P1012
error: Error validating datasource `db`: the URL must start with the protocol `file:`.
  -->  schema.prisma:10
   | 
 9 |     provider = "sqlite"
10 |     url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
   | 

Validation Error Count: 1
```

Run `npx prisma db push` so MongoDB can generate the schema based off of the Prisma schema. Now, running `npx prisma studio` will run without errors. You can also add entries from the GUI. ðŸ˜ƒ

## Clerk.dev - Implementing a login screen

Clerk is an authentication library. They claim *Clerk is more than a "sign-in box." Integrate complete user management UIs and APIs, purpose-built for React, Next.js, and the Modern Web.*

First, install clerk: `npm i @clerk/nextjs`

Navigate to their [website](https://clerk.dev) and make an account. Make a new application and enable the 'username' option. Then, make a dummy account with a weak password. Go to API Keys and copy the two secret codes, pasting it into your `.env`.

Go to your `_app.tsx` file and surround the `<Component>...` as such: (You need to import @clerk/nextjs as well)

```tsx
const MyApp: AppType = ({ Component, pageProps }) => {
  return <ClerkProvider {...pageProps}>
    <Component {...pageProps} />
  </ClerkProvider>;
};
```

Add a middleware file, so we can intercept every request made to our website and show the login screen when needed

```tsx
// Location: ./src/middleware.ts
// MUST BE NAMED MIDDLEWARE.TS
import { authMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs";
 
// This example protects all routes including api/trpc routes
// Please edit this to allow other routes to be public as needed.
// See https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware for more information about configuring your Middleware
export default authMiddleware({});
 
export const config = {
      matcher: ['/((?!.+\\.[\\w]+$|_next).*)', '/', '/(api|trpc)(.*)'],
};
```

Let's make sure it works. Run the project and go to `localhost:3000`, you will be redirected to clerk's account sign-in. Log in, then you will be shown the content.

We can also add a sign-in button (though clerk seems to automatically force me to sign in):

```tsx
// In ./src/index.tsx
export default function Home() {
  const user = useUser();
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>Create T3 App</title>
        <meta name="description" content="Generated by create-t3-app" />
        <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
      </Head>
      <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-center bg-gradient-to-b from-[#2e026d] to-[#15162c]">
        <div>
          {user.isSignedIn ? <SignOutButton></SignOutButton> : <SignInButton></SignInButton>}
        </div>
      </main>
    </>
  );
}
```

The button will probably look like black text on a dark purple background.

# Writing Twitter ripoff code: blaze your glory ðŸ”¥ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜­

Think about the key parts to a Twitter post...

Add it to your schema, then `npx prisma db push` to update.

`npm i` to refresh the TypeScript code.

## What is tRPC?

tRPC is the library we use to create our own API. It relies on TypeScript so your IDE can tell you what endpoints you have on your backend that you want the general user to be able to call in something like a web browser.
